We have 
folder_a/app_1.0
folder_b/app_1.1
----------------------------------
# switch to repo A
cd folder_a

# Add repo B as a remote repository
git remote add folderb /path/to/folder_b

# Pull B's master branch into a local branch named 'b'
git pull folderb master:b

# Merge b into A's master branch
git merge b

# Switch to repo B
cd ../folder_b

# Add repo A as a remote repository
git remote add foldera /path/to/folder_a

# Pull the resulting branch into repo B's master branch
git pull foldera master:master
